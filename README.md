### Overview

The Central Arctic Ocean hosts diverse biota that drive crucial global biogeochemical cycles, including carbon cycling. This study explores the functional potential of microbiota to fix carbon using alternative pathways and their chemolithotrophic characteristics, using samples from the MOSAiC & SAS-Oden expeditions (2019-2021).

### Key Findings

- **Metagenomic Data**: Analysis of metagenomic data revealed about 1200 mOTUs (metagenomic Operational Taxonomic Units).
- **Carbon Fixation Pathways**: Among the six pathways, three were prominent: rTCA, DC-HP, and HP-HP. The rTCA cycle was the most prevalent, observed in 5 out of 6 selected mOTUs.
- **Taxa**: Dominant taxa included bacterial phyla Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexota, Marinisomatota, and archaeal phyla Thermoplasmota.
- **Metabolic Processes**: Microbiota showed potential for oxidizing inorganic compounds with high redox potentials, supporting their chemolithotrophic nature.

### Conclusion

This study highlights the metabolic potential of Central Arctic Ocean microbiota and underscores the importance of understanding this diverse and intricate ecosystem.
